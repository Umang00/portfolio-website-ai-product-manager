Make changes in My Toolkit and make 2 sections rather than single one

Overall
- Capsules: rounded-full, px-3 py-1, text-sm, bg-neutral-900, border border-neutral-800, hover:bg-neutral-800.
- Cards: like we already have for others
- Responsive across devices

SECTION A — Core Skills
Title: “Core Skills”
Subtitle: “Capabilities I bring to product building.”
Layout:
- Category groups with capsule tags (no icons).
- Categories (headers) and capsules EXACTLY from this data:
const coreSkills = [
  { header: "Product Management", items: ["MVP Building","Feature Prioritization","Roadmapping","PRD Writing","Cross-Functional Leadership","Experimentation Design","API Integration"]},
  { header: "AI Development", items: ["LLM Fine-Tuning","LoRA Training","RAG Systems","Voice Agent Development","Prompt Engineering","Context Engineering","Function Calling","Tool Integration","Agentic Workflow Design","Text-to-Image Generation","Image-to-Image Translation","Inpainting & Outpainting","Style Transfer","ControlNet Implementation","Model Training"]},
  { header: "Data & Analytics", items: ["SQL Analytics","Data Pipeline Design","Funnel Analysis","Cohort Analysis","Dashboard Building","Statistical Analysis","Performance Metrics","Vector Embeddings","Data Cleaning"]},
  { header: "User & Growth", items: ["User Research","UX Strategy","Onboarding Optimization","Retention Strategy","Engagement Design","A/B Testing","Conversion Optimization"]},
  { header: "Content & Strategy", items: ["Content Strategy","Storytelling","Trend Integration","Campaign Design","Growth Experiments"]},
  { header: "Product Operations", items: ["Roadmap Execution","Feedback Loops","Documentation","Knowledge Management","Experiment Tracking","Stakeholder Management"]},
];

SECTION B — Tech Stack
Title: “Tech Stack”
Subtitle: “Technologies and tools I use to ship products.”

Top banner (logos):
- Two continuous rows of tool icons that auto-wrap and scroll horizontally on small screens; no scroll on desktop.
- Use recognizable logos (SVGs) with tooltip labels.
- Order: React, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Node.js, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq, Hugging Face, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Supabase, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Vercel, AWS, Docker, GitHub, Mixpanel, PostHog, Figma, Notion, Linear, Cursor, ElevenLabs and keep other which are already there
- Spacing tight but consistent; icons in pill buttons matching capsule style.

Below banner (category cards with capsules, no icons inside cards):
const techStack = [
  { header: "AI & ML Platforms", items: ["OpenAI","Anthropic","Groq","Grok","Gemini","OpenRouter","Hugging Face","ElevenLabs","Whisper","Runway ML","HeyGen"]},
  { header: "AI Development Frameworks", items: ["LangChain","LlamaIndex","AutoGen","CrewAI","DSPy","ComfyUI","FlashAttention","Gradio","Baseten"]},

];

Component requirements
- Build <SkillsAndStack/> that renders two sections using the above arrays.
- Create <Capsule> and <CategoryCard> subcomponents for reuse.
- Implement a responsive grid: cards in 1-col (mobile), 2-col (md), 3-col (xl).
- Add subtle entrance animation (opacity/translate) respecting prefers-reduced-motion.
- Provide a simple LogoRow component for the two-line icon banner with tooltips.
